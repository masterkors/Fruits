        <h2>Grapefruit</h2>
        <p>Grapefruit is one of the healthiest citrus fruits. Besides being a good source of vitamins and minerals, it is known for its ability to aid weight loss and reduce insulin resistance. For example, in a study in 91 people, those who ate half a fresh grapefruit before meals lost 2.9 pounds (1.3 kg) more weight than those who didn’t. In the same study, the grapefruit group had a significant reduction in insulin levels and reduced insulin resistance. Also, eating grapefruit has been shown to reduce cholesterol levels and help prevent kidney stones.</p>

        <h2>Pineapple</h2>
        <p>Among the tropical fruits, pineapple is a nutrition superstar. One cup (237 ml) of pineapple provides 131% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) for vitamin C and 76% of the RDI for manganese. Pineapple also contains bromelain, a mixture of enzymes known for its anti-inflammatory properties and ability to digest protein. Test-tube and animal studies suggest that bromelain may help protect against cancer and tumor growth.</p>

        <h2>Avocado</h2>
        <p>Avocado is different from most other fruits. Most fruits are high in carbs, while avocado is low in carbs and comprised mainly of healthy fats. The majority of the fat in avocado is oleic acid, a monounsaturated fat linked to reduced inflammation and better heart health. In addition to healthy fats, avocados are loaded with potassium, fiber and magnesium. One whole avocado provides 28% of the RDI for potassium. Adequate potassium intake is associated with reduced blood pressure and a lower risk of stroke.</p>
